    "> This notebook is modified copy of [Adam Cooper](adamcooper@uchicago.edu)'s [Basic Jupyter Server](https://chameleoncloud.org/experiment/share/39ae6822-b078-4707-8323-76eaf3a7e213) version [2023-05-05](https://chameleoncloud.org/experiment/share/39ae6822-b078-4707-8323-76eaf3a7e213/version/2023-05-05)\n",

    "A Jupyter notebook is what you're looking at right now. It contains a mix of Markdown and code, which is a great interface for annotating code and allowing it to be run interactively. This notebook is (probably) running on Chameleon's JupyterHub server. This means that the code is being executed on a very resource-light instance which is only designed to interface with Chameleon APIs. \n",

If this notebook is having issues, and you're not sure you can fix it in a secure way, please submit a ticket to the Chameleon help desk.\n",
